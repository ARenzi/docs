IBMÂ® uses cloud operations as a service to monitor and maintain your environment, so that you can focus on building apps and services that run on top of the environment. IBM also handles platform updates, so that you can focus on the business.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local includes a private, syndicated catalog that displays the local services that are available exclusively to you. It also includes additional services that are syndicated from and available for you to use from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public. The syndicated catalog provides the function to create hybrid applications that consist of public and private services. You have the option to decide which public services meet the requirements for your business based on your data privacy and security criteria.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local sits on a virtual machine that is behind your company firewall, so that you have the highest performing and most secure cloud infrastructure available to you. IBM installs, remotely monitors, and manages {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local in your data center through IBM's relay technology.

*Figure 1. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local detailed overview*

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local environments have the same security standards as the public {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} in terms of operational security. You provide the hardware and infrastructure, which gives you control over infrastructure and physical security. Developer access to the local {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is controlled by your LDAP policies, which can be configured by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} team when they set up your environment. Within the local environment, using the Admin Console, you can manage user roles and permissions.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local comes with all included {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} runtimes and 64 GB of compute memory.

In addition, there is a set of services available for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local.

| **Type** | **Name** | **Description** |    
|----------|----------|-----------------|

### Relay

Relay is a delivery capability included with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local that enables IBM to automatically and consistently deliver the latest updates to all local deployments, so that you always have an up-to-date and secure system. Relay achieves secure connectivity through an open, outbound SSL, VPN tunnel that originates from the inception virtual machine on-premises by using certificates that are specific to each {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local instance. All initial {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} releases are available in the inception virtual machine, which also acts as an automation agent machine for deployments and updates. The SSL connection originates from the inception virtual machine, and once a secure connection is established back to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} automation server, we can check for the currency and consistency of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} releases, and begin deploying updates.

The traffic on this tunnel is automation for serving and maintaining the platform, compute resources, and services for your instance. The inbound web port 443 is used for this connection. Relay is restricted to automation agent-only access. IBM uses the relay capability to deliver platform updates through a consistent testing and validation process to ensure that all deployments pushed to your local environments are stable and secure.

You have complete visibility of the environment for incident, problem, change, capacity, and security management as an administrator.  Administrators access the information about their environment by using the Administration console. Relay technology keeps the Administration console current with the latest data. For more information about user access, security logs, syndicated catalog control, and communication for updates and problem repair, see [Managing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated](../admin/index.html#mng).

##Setting up your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local instance
{: #setuplocal}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local is designed to provide a private version of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public offering that is hosted on your own hardware, managed by you. You can use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services and runtimes to support your computing needs in a secure, customer-hosted and managed cloud environment.

IBM provides you access to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local by using a password-secured login.

##{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local infrastructure requirements
{: #localinfra}

For {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, you own the physical security and the infrastructure for hosting the local instance. IBM sets the following requirements for setting up {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local.
###Hardware
While there are requirements for the type and size of available hardware, you can choose any combination to meet the set resource total requirements.
<dl>
<dt>**VMware ESXi hardware**</dt>
<dd>
ESXi is a virtualization layer that runs on physical servers and that abstracts processor, memory, storage, and resources into multiple virtual machines. Choose any combination that meets the following resource totals, on the condition that minimum physical core count per ESXi is eight. The following specifications are for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} core runtime only.
<ul>
<li>48 Physical cores at 2.0 or more GHz each</li>
<li>756 GB of physical RAM</li>
</li>Total datastore size of 7.5 TB
<ul>
<li>7 TB datastore to hold {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}</li>
<li>500 GB datastore to hold the inception virtual machine</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you use multiple datastores, use the same prefix for each.</p>
</dd>
<dt>**High availability**</dt>
<dd>
To support a single node failure, you must have n+1 ESXi. For example, if two ESXis are used, meaning 16x cores each, then a third is needed.
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The customer VMware administrator can decide to enforce strict high availability failover in the cluster to guarantee resources.</p>
</dd>
<dt>**Network**</dt>
<dd>
Recommended requirements include a customer accessible port group with 7 customer network IP addresses that have outbound internet access in the same subnet. Then, define a second private VLAN between only the ESXis being used for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local. This VLAN is shown as a port group in VMware. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local uses it for the private subnet, which is more secure and can help avoid routing issues.<br />
<p>**Note**: IBM can detect if the network connection is lost. In the event that network connection is lost, IBM contacts you and works with your network specialist to resolve the issue.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

###vCenter server configuration
Review the following version, datacenter, resource pool, and datastore requirements.
<dl>
<dt>**Supported VMware versions**</dt>
<dd>vCenter and ESXi 5.1 and 5.5</dd>
<dt>**Supported VMware types**</dt>
<dd>vSphere Enterprise<br />
vSphere Enterprise plus, if you plan to use distributed virtual switches</dd>
<dt>**Datacenter**</dt>
<dd>Create a datacenter, if one does not exist.</dd>
<dt>**Datacenter folder**</dt>
<dd>Create a VM folder with the same name as the cluster, if you do not plan to grant Administrator access that is propagated from the datacenter.</dd>
<dt>**Cluster**</dt>
<dd>Create a cluster specifically for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local use. An example for the cluster name is `bluemix`.</dd>
<dt>**Resource pool**</dt>
<dd>Create a resource pool under the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local cluster. An example for resource pool name is `local`.</dd>
</dt>**Datastores**</dt>
<dd>Requires 7.5 TB for the initial deployment of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.<br />
<br />
**Note**: When you use more than one datastore, ensure that each one begins with the same prefix. Examples of multiple datastore names with the same prefix are `bluemix_datastore_01` and `bluemix_datastore_02`.</dd>
</dl>

###Network Bandwidth
Recommended throughput is 5 Mbps up and 5 Mbps down, and you can expect a monthly data usage of 10 GB. IBM establishes agreed upon windows when large bundles of data are delivered, which can be as large as 3 GB.
###VMware permissions
Set the following roles and permissions. Propagation is set for each permission. If the permission is propagated, the permission gets passed down through the object hierarchy. However, permissions for a child object always override permissions that are propagated from a parent object.
<dl>
<dt>**v Center Server**</dt>
<dd>Set the role as read-only and not propagated.<br />
<br />
**Note**: This role is needed to retrieve task status for specific disk operations.</dd>
<dt>**Datacenter**</dt>
<dd>Create the role "{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}" and grant permissions for **Datastore** including **Low level file operations** and **Update virtual machine files**.<br />
<br />
**Note**: This role is needed to support file posts to the datastores.</dd>
<dt>**Cluster**</dt>
<dd>Set the role as administrator and propagated.</dd>
<dt>**Datastores**</dt>
<dd>Set the role administrator and propagated for each {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} datastore.</dd>
<dt>**Network**</dt>
<dd>Set public and private port groups with the administrator role, not propagated.</dd>
</dl>

###Droplet Execution Agent (DEA) pool
Each DEA is configured with:
- 16 - 32 GB of RAM
- 2x - 4x vCPU
- 150 - 300 GB of storage

For example, if the ESXi host size is 256 GB of memory with 16x cores, then eight DEAs are added. If the ESXi host size is 64 GB of memory with 8x cores, then two ESXis and four DEAs are required to be added. An additional 1.5 TB of storage is required for every four DEAs. This example is based on a DEA configured with 32 GB of RAM, 4x vCPU, and 300 GB of storage.

##Maintaining your local instance
{: #maintainlocal}

IBM maintains and installs updates and fixes as IBM deems appropriate to the Bluemix Local platform, runtimes, and services. Services might not be available during maintenance windows.

**Important**: IBM reserves the right to interrupt services to apply emergency maintenance as needed. IBM might change scheduled maintenance hours, but notifies you of any such changes, as well as any emergency maintenance information.

The following types of maintenance are required for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local:
<dl>
<dt>**Standard Maintenance Windows**</dt>
<dd>The services utilize pre-defined, standard maintenance windows, which might cause the services to be unavailable. IBM does not require customer approval to perform maintenance, but attempts to minimize impact to your services.<br />
<br />
IBM sends broadcast messages of the changes that are planned for each maintenance window, through email, phone, or other methods.<br />
<br />
**Important**: Some service might not be available to you during the maintenance period.</dd>

<dt>**Monthly Change Window**</dt>
<dd>The monthly maintenance window is applied based on coordination between you and IBM within a 21-day window. You can provide IBM with specific dates or times within the 21-day window that might not work for you. IBM attempts to schedule updates around those times. Based on the requests, IBM communicates the scheduled maintenance window to you. Monthly change windows are not expected to impact the running Bluemix Local environment.<br />
<br />
**Note**: If you do not request a specific time for the update, the maintenance is automatically applied at the end of the window.<br />
<br />
Go to **ADMINISTRATION > SYSTEM INFORMATION** to view pending updates, set unavailable dates, and approve updates. For more information about notifications and scheduling pending updates, see <a href="../admin/index.html#oc_system">Viewing system information</a>.</dd>

<dt>**Other**</dt>
<dd>IBM intends to confine all maintenance that might affect your services, in particular the availability of your Bluemix Local environment, runtimes, and services, to the standard and monthly windows. Other change windows might be used on an exception basis for management of the environment. IBM makes reasonable efforts to minimize the impact to you during such change windows and notifies you in advance.</dd>
</dl>

To set up maintenance of your local instance, work with your IBM designated account representative to identify an agreed upon window for the standard maintenance.

If there is a reported issue following a maintenance update, you agree with your IBM representative if it is in your best interest to allow IBM to roll back the update. Upon agreement, IBM rolls back the update to restore the environment to the previous state.

## Disaster recovery

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Public provides a continuously available platform for innovation. Multiple fail-safe measures ensure that your orgs, spaces, and apps are always available. Deploying apps to multiple geographic regions enables continuous availability that protects against unplanned, simultaneous loss of multiple hardware or software components, or the loss of an entire data center, so that even in the event of a natural disaster in one geographic location, your distributed {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public app instances in alternate geographic locations will be available.
{: shortdesc}

Disaster recovery for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Local is made possible through continuous availability for your apps, the inherent high availability of the platform, and the ability to restore your instance in the event of a failure. You are responsible for enabling continuous availability of your apps by deploying to multiple regions. High availability is built in at the platform level through technologies included in Cloud Foundry and other components. And, you can work together with IBM to ensure that your data is properly backed up in the case that you need to restore your instance at any time.

### Enabling continuous availability for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local
{: #enabling}

By default, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public deploys to multiple geographic locations. However, you must do the following to enable globally distributed {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local instances:

* Ensure that your developers are deploying apps in more than one region, either through a manual or automated process. Selected regions should be more than 200 km apart from each other to ensure that a natural disaster cannot affect both geographic locations.
* Configure a global load balancer, like Akamai or Dyn, to point to apps in at least two different regions.

**Note**: Not all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services support regional distribution. When you construct an app, if you want to achieve geographic distribution, then you must also make sure that the services that are used by that app have data synchronization as a key feature.

#### Deploying {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local apps to multiple geographic locations
{: #deploying}

To deploy into a second location or multiple locations, you must follow a process similar to the one you took to enable your primary geographic location:

1. Enable a new local environment to host additional instances of your applications. To create a new environment, contact your IBM sales team to initiate the process. For more information about setting up a local instance, see [Setting up {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local](../local/index.html#setuplocal). You must log in separately to access each environment. Each physical location for the hosted environments should be a minimum of 200 km away from the original location to ensure availability.
2. Obtain the unique domain name where your new deployed app will be hosted. For example, if your original domain is *mycompany.east.bluemix.net*, then you can create a new local environment with a new domain such as *mycompany.west.bluemix.net*, and deploy to the new domain.
3. Deploy to the new location each time you deploy your original app. For more information about deploying, see [Uploading your app](../starters/upload_app.html).


#### Enabling a global load balancer for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local
{: #glb}

A global load balancer not only ensures continuous availability and is required for disaster recovery, but it also has several additional benefits:

* Routes users to the closest {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region by default
* Routes based on performance
* Selectively directs a percentage of traffic to a new application version
* Provides site failover based on region health check
* Provides site failover based on application health check
* Uses weighted routing between endpoints

You can choose a global load balancer such as Akamai or Dyn. For more about using Akamai as a global load balancer, see [Global traffic management](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/solutions/products/web-performance/global-traffic-management.jsp){: new_window}. For more about using Dyn as a global load balancer, see [4 Reasons Businesses Are Taking Global Load Balancing to the Cloud](http://dyn.com/blog/4-reasons-businesses-are-taking-global-load-balancing-to-the-cloud/){: new_window}.

### High availability
{: #ha}

In addition to enabling continuous availability, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also provides high availability across the platform by using technologies built into Cloud Foundry, Docker, and other components.

These technologies include the following:

<dl>
<dt>Scalability in Cloud Foundry</dt>
<dd>A Cloud Foundry <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html" target="_blank">Droplet Execution Agent (DEA)</a> performs health checks on the apps running within it. If there is a problem with the app or the DEA itself, it deploys additional instances of the app to an alternate DEA to address the issue. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/high-availability.html" target="_blank">Configuring CF for High Availability with Redundancy</a>.
</dd>
<dt>Metadata backup</dt>
<dd>Metadata is backed up to a secondary location, typically an on-premises virtual machine. If possible, you should replicate the backup to your own environment at least 200 km away.</dd>
</dl>

##Restoring your local instance
{: #restorelocal}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local settings, metadata, and configurations are backed up regularly to prepare for any unplanned outages in the environment. Your data that you are responsible for backing up includes application data, cloud database services data, and object stores.

As part of the data backup, which includes system metadata and configurations, IBM completes the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>Encrypts all backup copies and manages encryption keys</li>
<li>Monitors and manages backup activity</li>
<li>Provides the encrypted backup files</li>
<li>Restores the requested data</li>
<li>Manages scheduling conflicts between backup and fix management operations</li>
</ul>

Because protection of private data is critical, IBM needs your collaboration when dealing with backup file management, so that the files are not moved outside of your data centers. Specifically, IBM asks that you complete the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>Move a copy of your encrypted backup data off-site, just as you would for any other backup data that you manage.</li>
<li>Provide the backup files for the IBM operator in case of any need to restore.</li>
</ul>
