{:shortdesc}

### Using Account and Support
Account and Support is a feature that enables you to check account information, view status, stay up to date with notifications, select your region, select and manage orgs, and log out. In addition, you can get help and provide feedback.

To open Account and Support, log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user interface and click the **Account and Support** icon ![Account and Support](images/account_support.svg) in the top menu bar.

Click **Get help** to find answers to your questions. On the page that is displayed, type your question in the search field. Answers from across the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} documentation and Stack Overflow are displayed. The page also provides options to post your question to Stack Overflow, or to open a ticket by clicking **GET IN TOUCH**.


### Asking a question
Whether accessed directly or through Account and Support, Stack Overflow is a website that serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions. The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} development and support teams are active on Stack Overflow, and follow the questions that are tagged with **bluemix**.

To ask a question in Stack Overflow, choose from the following options:
  * From Account and Support, click **Get help**. On the page that is displayed, type your question in the search field to find answers. If the expected answer is not returned, you can click **POST TO STACK OVERFLOW** to post your question.

  * Go directly to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bluemix){: new_window}.

When you create a question in Stack Overflow, add a **bluemix** tag to your question to ensure that it is seen by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} development and support teams.



## Viewing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} status
{: #viewing-bluemix-status}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Status page is the central place to find notifications and announcements about key events that are affecting the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform and the major services in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

On the Status page, you can find the following information:

  * The current status of services and components in all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} regions.
  * A list of announcements, in chronological order, for maintenance and incidents. You can filter the list or open an individual announcement for more details.
  * Planned maintenance windows, which are posted at least 24 hours in advance, except in extreme circumstances.
  * Unplanned incidents or outages, which are posted as soon as the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} team becomes aware of them. Incident notifications are regularly updated until they are resolved.
  * References to security bulletins that affect the various {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services or the platform.
  * Other platform-wide announcements of general interest to you.
  * An RSS feed to subscribe to.

You can find the Status page by choosing either of the following options:

  * Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user interface, click the **Account and Support** icon ![Account and Support](./images/account_support.svg) in the top menu bar, and then click **Status**. Check the listed resources for the ![some issues](images/some_issues.svg) icon. This icon might indicate an outage.
  * Access it directly at [IBM {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} - System Status](https://status.eu-gb.bluemix.net/){: new_window}.


### Subscribing to an RSS feed

You can also be alerted of any notifications by subscribing to the RSS feed for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Status page. This approach provides a way for you to get updates without having to regularly consult the status page.

To subscribe, follow these steps:

  1. Download and install an RSS reader.
  2. Use your reader to subscribe to the feed with one of the following methods:
       * Drag the ![RSS](images/rss.svg) icon into your RSS reader.
       * Right-click the RSS icon, select **Copy link address**, and paste the URL into your RSS reader.

	See your reader's **Help** section for more information. 	   

Other methods of reading RSS feeds are also available through web browser plug-ins such as [RSS Feed](http://feeder.co/){: new_window} Reader for Chrome or [Brief](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/brief/){: new_window} add-on for Firefox, or with other news sources like [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com/){: new_window} or [G2reader](http://www.g2reader.com/en/){: new_window}.

You can also use a third-party service to automatically send an email for each RSS update. The following list provides some example third-party services:

  * www.feedmyinbox.com
  * www.rssforward.com
  * www.feedrabbit.com
  * www.mailchimp.com
  * www.feedmailer.com
  * www.iftt.com

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} typically has approximately 50 updates per month.

### Best practices for monitoring status

  * Check for upcoming maintenance windows

	Check for upcoming maintenance windows posted on the status page, at least once every 24 hours, by using one of the following options:
	  * By navigating directly to the [Status](https://status.eu-gb.bluemix.net/){: new_window} page
	  * By using the RSS feed or an RSS-to-email forwarder

  * Check for current maintenance windows or an incident in progress

	If you suspect that {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is not functioning as expected, check the status page for current maintenance windows or an incident in progress. To report an incident that is not already listed on the status page, open a Support ticket through the **Account and Support** icon ![Account and Support](images/account_support.svg) in the top menu bar or the [IBM {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support](https://support.eu-gb.bluemix.net/gethelp/){: new_window} help page.

  * Take advantage of multiple {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} regions

    All users of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public automatically have access to the US-SOUTH, EU-GB, and AU-SYD regions:

	  * US-SOUTH: https://console.ng.bluemix.net
	  * EU-GB: https://console.eu-gb.bluemix.net
	  * AU-SYD: https://console.au-syd.bluemix.net

	The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Global Operations team manages all regions to avoid maintenance impacts and minimize the risk of incidents that affect all regions at the same time.

  * Prepare for minor interruptions

    In most cases, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} can continue to be used normally, even during the maintenance window. However, minor interruptions of a service can't always be avoided. Running applications typically remain available even if the application management functions of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, such as starting and stopping apps, are temporarily interrupted. To maximize the availability of your running applications, run at least three instances of each application.



## Contacting support
{: #contacting-support}

You can open support tickets if you have a valid {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated or {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local customers also get an option to purchase additional premium support that enables remote access to a named support lead, who is a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} technical advisor and product specialist.

If you were unable to resolve your technical problem with the troubleshooting and help options, you can ask for support. However, before contacting support for a technical issue, ensure that the problem is not due to an outage by checking {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} status.

When you open a support ticket, ensure that you indicate an appropriate severity for your ticket. The severity determines how your ticket is handled.

If your request is urgent, but your account's 30-day trial subscription period has expired and you don't have the Support add-on, you can upgrade your account to submit high-severity (level 1, 2, and 3) tickets.
